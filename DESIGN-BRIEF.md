# Workout Tracker - Logo Design Brief

## App Overview

**Workout Tracker** is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for serious lifters who follow structured progressive overload programs. It's a mobile-first tool that helps users track their strength training workouts, automatically manage weight progression, and monitor long-term performance.

---

## Core Functionality

### What It Does
- **Tracks Workout Sessions**: Users log 3-4 exercises per session (deadlifts, squats, bench press, etc.)
- **Progressive Overload System**: Automatically increases weights when users hit their targets
- **Intelligent Deload Weeks**: Reduces weight by 25% every 4 weeks for recovery
- **Performance Analytics**: Shows progress over time with clean data visualization
- **Phone Number Authentication**: Quick, secure login via SMS OTP

### Workout Flow
1. User opens the app → sees today's workout
2. Taps an exercise card → bottom sheet slides up
3. Edits weight if needed → taps "Hit Target" or "Missed"
4. Repeats for all exercises → taps "Finish Workout"
5. App automatically calculates next session's weights

## Design Philosophy: "Industrial Minimalist"

### Visual Aesthetic
- **Professional Over Playful**: No emojis, no gradients, no decorative elements
- **High Contrast**: Black, white, and grays with accent colors (green for success, red for failure)
- **Typography-First**: Uses Vercel Geist Sans (clean, technical) and Geist Mono (for numbers/data)
- **Clean White Space**: Generous padding, clear hierarchy, nothing cluttered
- **Subtle Depth**: Minimal shadows, refined borders, backdrop blur effects

### Design Influences
- **Notion**: Clean typography, scannable lists, professional tone
- **Linear**: Focused interactions, high-contrast UI, deliberate color use
- **Ramp**: Card-based hierarchy, data-first approach
- **Native iOS**: Bottom navigation, bottom sheets, feels like a real app

### Color Palette
```
Primary Text:     #111827 (Almost Black)
Secondary Text:   #6B7280 (Medium Gray)
Success:          #10B981 (Green - WCAG AA compliant)
Error:            #EF4444 (Red - WCAG AA compliant)
Action/Primary:   #000000 (Pure Black)
Background:       #FFFFFF (White)
Borders:          #E5E7EB (Light Gray)
```

## Technical Context

### Platform
- Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Installable to iPhone home screen
- Runs fullscreen without Safari chrome
- Feels completely native on iOS

### Key UI Elements
- **Bottom Navigation**: Two tabs (Train / Progress)
- **Exercise Cards**: Clean cards with status indicators (○ todo, ✓ done, ✗ missed)
- **Bottom Sheets**: iOS-style slide-up modals for focused input
- **Fixed Actions**: Prominent "Finish Workout" button at bottom

### Screen Sizes
- Mobile-first (375px minimum width)
- Optimized for iPhone (includes notch/dynamic island support)
- Max width: 448px (centered on larger screens)

---

## Logo Requirements

### Deliverables Needed
1. **App Icon** (512×512px, PNG)
   - Square format for iOS home screen
   - Legible at small sizes (60×60px on device)
   - Works on white and colored backgrounds

2. **Apple Touch Icon** (180×180px, PNG)
   - Optimized for iOS specifically
   - Will have rounded corners applied by iOS

3. **SVG Version** (Scalable)
   - For use in web contexts
   - Should work at any size

4. **Variations**
   - Full color version
   - Monochrome version (for dark mode, if needed)
   - Wordmark version (if applicable)

### Design Considerations

**Icon Constraints:**
- Must be legible at 60×60px (actual size on iPhone home screen)
- Should work on both light and dark backgrounds
- Avoid fine details that disappear at small sizes
- Consider how it looks with iOS's rounded corner treatment

**Brand Fit:**
- Should feel **technical** and **precise**, not energetic or playful
- **Minimalist** aesthetic - simple shapes, clean lines
- Could incorporate:
  - Barbell/weight plate silhouette (abstracted, not literal)
  - Upward arrow/progression symbol
  - Graph/chart element (data-driven feel)
  - Geometric shapes (architectural, precise)
  - Letterforms (monogram like "W" or "WT")

**Color Approach:**
- **Option 1**: Pure black (#000000) icon on white background
  - Most consistent with the "Industrial Minimalist" aesthetic
  - Current placeholder uses this approach
- **Option 2**: Single accent color + black/white
  - Could use green (#10B981) to represent progress/success
- **Avoid**: Multiple colors, gradients, or decorative elements

**Typography (if using letters):**
- Geist Sans is the app's primary font
- Bold weight (700) for impact
- Tight letter-spacing (-0.05em)
- Consider a monogram or abstracted letterform

## Inspiration & References

### Similar Aesthetics (NOT fitness apps)
- **Linear** (project management) - Clean, technical, high contrast
- **Vercel** (developer platform) - Minimalist, monochrome, precise
- **Arc Browser** - Modern, refined, focused
- **Things 3** - Clean task management, subtle depth
- **Monzo** (banking app) - Minimal, data-first, professional

### Anti-Inspiration (Avoid These)
- MyFitnessPal (cluttered, gamified)
- Fitbit (too playful, consumer-focused)
- Nike Training Club (motivational, energetic)
- Peloton (lifestyle brand, aspirational)
